# Road Design Optimization Using Least Squares and QR Factorization

This project involves using computational methods to design highways that connect four cities without passing through them. The methods employed include least squares for fitting roads and QR factorization for optimizing these fits. The coordinates of the cities are (-2,3), (0,1), (3,0), and (5,2).

## Exercise Overview

### Description

Bob, a city planner, is tasked with designing highways connecting four cities. The challenge is to avoid city centers while keeping the roads as close to these centers as possible. The project utilizes least squares methods to propose road designs and QR factorization to refine these proposals.

### Exercises

a. **Least Squares for Straight Road**: Fit a straight road that approximates the best path connecting the cities using the least squares method.

b. **Least Squares for Curved Road**: Fit a curved road using a polynomial model optimized by the least squares method.

c. **Error Analysis**: Calculate the root mean squared error (RMSE) for both road designs to assess their accuracy.

d. **QR Factorization**: Use the Gram-Schmidt process to perform QR factorization on the design matrices of the roads to potentially improve their alignment with the cities' coordinates.
